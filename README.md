## Become A Job Ready Django Developer

***Django is a Python-based web framework that uses the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern. Django's main goal is to make it easier to create complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes component reusability and "pluggability," less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the don't repeat yourself principle. Python is used everywhere, including settings, files, and data models. Django also includes an optional administrative create, read, update, and delete interface that is generated dynamically via introspection and configured through admin models.***

**Django is used by some well-known websites, including Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus, National Geographic, Spotify, Bitbucket, Nextdoor, and Pinterest.**
